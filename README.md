# DS4002 Project 3 - Facial Mask Image Recognition

## Team Mango:
* Rithwik Raman (xak7jw)
* Pranav Arora (aub5uy)
* Ayush Acharya (htb4hv)

## Description
### This repository contains our project's datasets, scripts, and generated visualizations. The project uses facial image data of individuals either with out without masks and uses image recognition models to detect if an indivdual is wearing a mask or not. 


## (TODO -- need to revamp) Software and Platform
* Development was performed in a Python-based Jupyter notebook.
* The following Python packages were imported:
  * Pandas
  * Matplotlib
  * Seaborn
  * NumPy
  * Scikit-learn
  * TensorFlow
  * Keras
  * StatsModels
  * NeuralProphet
* Scripts were run on the Google Colab Runtime Environment platform.

## (TODO -- need to revamp) Reproducing these Results
* Download the dataset from: https://github.com/rithwikraman/DS4002-Project2/blob/main/DATA/household_power_consumption_dataset.csv
* Upload the dataset to your Google Colab Runtime Environment
* Update .read_csv() to the location of your household_power_consumption_dataset.csv dataset
* Run the Jupyter Notebook (script file) and view the results (note that the LSTM model may take longer to run)
